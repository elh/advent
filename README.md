Learning Clojure via [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## 2022 (in progress)

At the moment, I have no project or test set up. Each day is solved in a separate file I just run as main w/ an input file.

Example:
```
clj -M 2022/4/4.clj 2022/4/example-input.txt
clj -M 2022/4/4.clj 2022/4/input.txt
```
